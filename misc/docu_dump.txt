========================                                                    
                                                                            
Overview                                                                    
--------                                                                    
PeasyGUI is a lightweight graphical user interface that can be controlled   
by your own program. Your program and PeasyGUI communicate using a simple   
text-based protocol over TCP.                                               
                                                                            
When PeasyGUI is started with --protocol=tcp, it opens a small TCP server   
that listens for requests from your application. Your program connects as a 
client, sends requests and receives clear, text-based replies in return.    
                                                                            
All communication happens quickly and reliably, so your application can     
update the GUI or react to user actions almost instantly.

There are four types of requests:                                           
- events?                                                                   
- get                                                                       
- set                                                                       
- new.                                                                      
                                                                            
The last two (set and new) do not return information but simply reply with  
either OK or an error message in the form ERROR`...`. Multiple set or new   
requests can be combined into a single TCP packet.                          
                                                                            
All elements in a request are separated by a backtick (`). Be careful not   
to confuse the backtick with an apostrophe (') or accent (´).               
                                                                            
                                                                            
The 'events?' Request                                                       
---------------------                                                       
The events? request has no parameters. It returns all active events that    
have occurred since the last events? query. Each event is followed by a     
line break.                                                                 
If an event includes additional information (such as mouse coordinates),    
that data is appended directly after the event name.                        
                                                                            
Example:                                                                    
If the button named ok_button is clicked, then the window is resized and    
finally closed, PeasyGUI will respond with:                                 
ok_button`Clicked`                                                          
Window`Resized`346,549`                                                     
Window`Resized`370,566`                                                     
Window`Closed`                                                              
                                                                            
If no events occurred in the meantime, the reply will be:                   
NONE                                                                        
                                                                            
                                                                            
The 'get' Request                                                           
-----------------                                                           
Format:                                                                     
get`ControlName`Property`                                                   
                                                                            
Example:                                                                    
get`TextBox_0`Text`                                                         
                                                                            
If the user has entered 'Hello, World!' into the text box, PeasyGUI will    
respond with:                                                               
OK`Hello, World!`                                                           
                                                                            
If a control contains multiple entries, the property name begins with       
'Entire', for example:                                                      
get`ListBox_7`EntireTexts`                                                  
                                                                            
PeasyGUI will respond with:                                                 
OK`dog`cat`mouse`                                                           
                                                                            
                                                                            
The 'set' Request                                                           
-----------------                                                           
Format:                                                                     
set`ControlName`Property`Value`                                             
                                                                            
Example:                                                                    
set`TextBox_0`Text`42`                                                      
                                                                            
The 'Entire' prefix can also be used here to assign multiple values, for    
example:                                                                    
set`MyListBox`EntireTexts`a`bc`def`                                         
                                                                            
This will clear the ListBox and then fill it with the following entries:    
a                                                                           
bc                                                                          
def                                                                         
                                                                            
                                                                            
The 'new' Request                                                           
-----------------                                                           
Format:                                                                     
new`ControlName`Type`ControlType`                                           
                                                                            
Example:                                                                    
new`cancel_button`Type`Button`                                              
                                                                            
This adds a new control of the specified type to the GUI. The control will  
have default properties, which can then be modified using set requests.     
                                                                            
                                                                            
File-Based Communication                                                    
------------------------                                                    
The file-based communication mode (--protocol=filebased) works but is       
significantly slower than TCP. It was originally intended as an alternative 
for corporate environments where running a local server might not be        
allowed.                                                                    
                                                                            
However, because it relies on disk file exchanges for every request, it     
becomes inefficient, especially for frequent get requests.                  
                                                                            
                                                                            
                                                                            
Building Your GUI                                                           
=================                                                           
                                                                            
Using INI Files                                                             
---------------                                                             
Instead of constructing the entire GUI from your code, you can predefine    
parts (or all) of it using an INI file. The easiest way to create one is    
with the built-in WYSIWYG Design Editor.                                    
                                                                            
Start PeasyGUI without parameters. It will look for a file named            
PeasyGUI.ini in the application root directory and load it. You can add or  
reposition controls, resize them, and edit their properties in the table.   
                                                                            
When PeasyGUI is closed, it will create or update the INI file              
automatically. The contents of this file (a sequence of new and set         
requests) can also be sent to PeasyGUI over TCP, either as a single block   
or as individual requests.                                                  
                                                                            
                                                                            
Working with the Design Editor                                              
------------------------------                                              
The design editor is mostly self-explanatory, but some aspects of its       
operation are slightly unusual. When you hover the mouse over a control,    
blue squares appear at its corners and edges. These allow you to resize the 
control. The blue square in the center allows you to move the control.      
                                                                            
Clicking any of the squares will show the control’s properties in the table 
view. You can also click directly inside a control (not on the blue         
squares) to just interact with it, for example to edit the text in a        
TextBox or test selection behavior in a ListBox.                            
                                                                            
                                                                            
Paths and Resources                                                         
-------------------                                                         
Wherever PeasyGUI accepts a path (for example, to icons, INI files, image   
sources, or the exchange directory), you may use either absolute paths or   
paths relative to the application root directory. So the folder that        
contains bin/ on Linux and Windows (but is not inside it), or the folder    
that contains PeasyGUI.app/ on macOS.                                       
                                                                            
                                                                            
Controls and Properties                                                     
=======================                                                     
                                                                            
Geometry

The 4 numbers of the geometry represent left, top, width, height of the     
control within the window.

The Show property controls how a control is displayed and whether it can be 
interacted with. It has four possible values:                               
- Normal: The control is visible and fully interactive.                     
- Disabled: The control is visible but cannot be interacted with using the  
mouse or keyboard.                                                          
- Invisible: The control is not visible.                                    
- ToBeDeleted: Used only in Design mode. Controls set to this state will    
not be saved to the INI file when PeasyGUI is closed.
